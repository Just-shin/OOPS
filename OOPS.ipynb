    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "    The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes and Objects >>\n",
    "    Class:- A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data.\n",
    "    Object:- An instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class with actual values.\n",
    "    Encapsulation >>\n",
    "    The practice of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "    Inheritance >>\n",
    "    A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "    Polymorphism >>\n",
    "    The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name.\n",
    "    Abstraction >>\n",
    "    The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort."

The MRO is a linearization of the inheritance hierarchy that Python uses to determine the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. Python’s MRO follows the C3 linearization algorithm. Also python's 'super()' function can be used which helps in navigating the MRO and resolving the Diamond Problem by ensuring that each class's method is called in the correct order."
